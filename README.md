- 👋 Hi, I’m @jossw27
- 🌱 I’m currently learning front-end web development. My goal over the next few months is to learn front-end with the hope of progressing to a career. I would love to meet like-minded people and develop and push myself to new things. I currently work in IT 	Support after falling into it, after completing a BSc Zoology degree and struggling to find steady work. I have reached the acceptance stage I am now working in IT and want to do something for myself. I love the challenge of coding and being able to create. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects and progressing my skills and knowledge and meet like-minded people.
- 📫 How to reach me you can contact me at jos.watson7@gmail.com
