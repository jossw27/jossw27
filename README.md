- 👋 Hi, I’m @jossw27
- 🌱 I’m currently learning front-end web development. My goal over the next few months is to learn front-end and progressing to a career.
  
  Currently I work in IT Support, after completing a BSc Zoology degree and struggling to find steady work. Being able to restart a computer led me to a steady job.

  Now have reached the acceptance stage I am now working in IT and want to do something for myself. I love the challenge of coding and being able to create and I really want to push myself to do something I find challenging but really enjoyable.
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects and progressing my skills and knowledge and meet like-minded people.
  
- 📫 How to reach me you can contact me at
